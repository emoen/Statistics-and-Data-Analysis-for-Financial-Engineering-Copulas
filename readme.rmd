## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Plot of generator function for frank cupola

```{r Frank Copula generator function}
library(copula)
u= seq(0.000001, 1, length=500)
frank = iPsi(copula=archmCopula(family="frank", param=1), u)
plot(u, frank, type="l", lwd=3, ylab=expression(phi(u)))
abline(h=0)
abline(v=0)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
